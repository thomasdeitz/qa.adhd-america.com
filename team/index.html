      <h1>The Mission</h1><p><strong>Our mission, together with adhd america, is to make a difference in the lives of those impacted by this disorder.</strong></p>
<p>We believe that many parents, particularly those in underserved communities, are unaware of the consequences ADHD can have on the lives of their children. Parents also need to understand their legal rights to advocate on behalf of their children for school accommodations. In addition, they need to be aware of the side effects of ADHD medication, both physically and mentally.</p>
